For this exercise I'm sending one free API to play with Cocktails :)

https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

 

Based on their documentation, we can notice that the cocktail can be searched by:

- Name (www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita)

- First letter

- By ingredient (www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=Gin)

- by ID

- Randomly

etc.

 

By using Jmeter, you should automate 5-10 test scenarios where you will validate the following:

1. For the Search Cocktail By Name API, to be validated Response Code and Message in case of positive and negative scenarios.

2. For the Search Cocktail By Name API, to be validated the expected elements in response message.

3. For the Search Cocktail By Name API, to be validated some values from the response message for a given Coctail.

4. Execute Search by ingredient API. From the list of cocktail, randomly pick one (Not the first one, but a random one!!). Use that cocktail name as input parameter for Search Cocktail By Name API. Ingredients from both responses to be compared and to be validated they are the same.

 

Note: Please use parameters when executing the APIs. Parameters can be called from User Defined Variables.

Note2: Feel free to add other API calls to exercise even better.
